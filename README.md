# 100-days-of-Machine-Learning

Day1 - Day 1 of learning Numpy! Numpy is a powerful Python library used for numerical computing. It provides a fast and efficient way to work with arrays, and is widely used in the fields of data science, machine learning, and scientific computing.

Day2 and 3 - Welcome to Day 2 of learning Pandas! Pandas is a powerful Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive Refer book - https://github.com/shyamkumarchauhan/learn-python-with-shyam/blob/master/cheatsheet/Pandas-Cookbook-eBook.pdf.

Day4 - Some More Pandas advanced concepts multiindexing,pivottable, datetime concepts Refer to my blog on pivot table : https://medium.com/@tahera-firdose/exploring-data-with-pivot-tables-in-pandas-a-practical-guide-with-examples-from-the-titanic-938f65f64285

Day 5 -data visualization using the Matplotlib library in Python.

Matplotlib is a powerful data visualization library widely used by data scientists, analysts, and researchers to create informative and appealing visualizations. It provides a range of tools for creating various types of plots, including line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, heatmaps, and more.

The examples in this repository cover different use cases and demonstrate how to use Matplotlib to create effective and informative visualizations. The examples include:

Line Chart: A simple example of creating a line chart using Matplotlib.

Bar Chart: An example of creating a bar chart to compare data across different categories.

Scatter Plot: An example of creating a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between two variables.

Histogram: An example of creating a histogram to visualize the distribution of a dataset.

Heatmap: An example of creating a heatmap to visualize the correlation between variables in a dataset.

Day 6: Data Visualization using  Plotly, which is a powerful data visualization library in Python. Plotly allows us to create interactive and dynamic visualizations, making it a great tool for exploratory data analysis and storytelling.

I explore the various features and capabilities of Plotly and learnt how to create basic plots such as line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts. Additionally, explored more advanced visualizations like heatmaps, 3D plots, and animated plots.

Day 7,8,9 - During these three days, I covered a range of SQL concepts and techniques. I started with the basics, such as creating tables, inserting data, and querying data using the SELECT statement and then progress to more advanced topics, including joins, aggregations, subqueries, and data manipulation.

I also solved some question from Leetcode. Refer to PDF for the database questions with solutions

Also followed https://www.youtube.com/@techTFQ and learnt some important concepts like subqueries, joins, windows and normalization.

Day 10 - Data Visualiation using Tableau
